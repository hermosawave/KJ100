            <h2>Help bring our milestone issue to print: be a part of Kyoto Journal 100</h2>
            <p>
                Kyoto Journal, like many in the publishing industry, was hit hard by the pandemic. A growing number of challenges sadly forced us to suspend our print issues and move to digital in order to continue. As a volunteer-run, independent publisher, we are committed to creating thoughtfully written and designed issues that transmute the striking spectrum of Kyoto into engaging stories. We also believe in the value of holding an issue in your hands as a part of this experience, a tangible connection between the reader and Kyoto. And one of the best ways readers can strengthen Kyoto Journal’s return to print is to support us directly through donations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To mark the tremendous milestone of our upcoming 100th issue, we are determined to honor the expectations of our dedicated readers by going back to print. This special issue, centred around the theme “100 views of Kyotos”, will not only be a representation of our 32 years of work, but also of a vivid prism of perspectives, experiences, and conceptualizations of Kyoto brought to the page and into your hands. We are humbled by any contribution you make to be a part of this landmark publication and ensure we bring KJ100 to print. Donors will be recognized on our website and through social media and receive updates as we continue to create this issue and develop a path to sustainability. Our deepest thanks for your interest in supporting our magazine; any donation truly makes an enormous difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are endlessly thankful to our subscribers and readers who have supported us for so long.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Help Kyoto Journal  Celebrate our Milestone 100th Issue!
Kyoto Journal is recognized worldwide for its superb print quality, embodying an essential Kyoto tradition of fine design. Since 2017 our all-volunteer team has made tremendous efforts to maintain this signature feature, producing nine beautiful print issues consecutively funded by subscriptions, book and back issue sales. Unfortunately the impact of the pandemic forced us to publish our two most recent issues (KJ 98 & 99) digitally.
 To mark the milestone of our upcoming 100th issue, we are determined to honor the expectations of our dedicated readers by going back to print. Under the current circumstances, this means stretching KJ's financial resources to the limit. 
Please consider supporting us today with a small contribution. It will make a huge difference!
[Current subscribers will receive KJ100 in print as part of their subscription; it will also be available for purchase through our website]
