            <h2>Help bring our milestone issue to print: be a part of Kyoto Journal 100</h2>
            <p>
                Kyoto Journal is recognized worldwide for its superb print quality, embodying an essential Kyoto tradition of fine design. Since 2017 our independent, all-volunteer team has created nine beautiful print issues consecutively funded by subscriptions, book and back issue sales. Unfortunately the impact of the pandemic forced us to publish our two most recent issues (KJ 98 &amp; 99) digitally. But we believe that holding our magazine is an essential, tangible connection between the reader and Kyoto. To mark the tremendous milestone of our upcoming 100th issue, we are determined to honor the expectations of our dedicated readers by going back to print. To do this, we are asking for your help to raise ¥X.</p>
            <p>
                Kyoto Journal 100, centered around the theme “100 views of Kyoto”, will not only be a representation of our 32 years of work, but also of a vivid prism of perspectives, experiences, and conceptualizations of Kyoto brought to the page and into your hands. This issue marks how far we have come and where we are going next. By meeting our fundraising goal, we will bring KJ100 to print and pave the way to creating a sustainable future for Kyoto Journal that includes events, workshops, courses, and books. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By donating ¥X you will receive a copy of KJ100. If you are a current subscriber, you will receive a copy as part of your subscription. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Donors names will be printed in the issue, as well as recognized on our website and through social media. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our deepest thanks for your interest in supporting our magazine. Any donation truly makes an enormous difference.
            </p>
